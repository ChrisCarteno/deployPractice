# CSS Assessment - Part II

Here are some important notes about this test.

1. This test has one HTML and one CSS file.
2. Do **NOT** modify the **index.html** file. Only write code in the
   **your-code.css** file.
3. Your CSS will be auto-graded using Cypress tests, but you will not be able to
   run those tests yourself. Because of this, it is important to read the
   directions carefully and apply your CSS rules to the exact elements that are
   described in the directions.

## Usage

1. Clone the assessment repository from the green button below.
2. Open both the **index.html** and **your-code.css** file in VS Code.
3. Open **index.html** in Google Chrome.
4. Make changes to the **your-code.css** file following the directions until
   the targeted elements look like the provided images when viewed in the
   browser.
